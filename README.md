# Commerce

This project was part of my CS50 Web Programming course. 

## Functionality

This website acts like an online auction platform, imitating websites like eBay. The user has ability to register, but even without registration, they can stroll
through the active auction items. Every auction item has a page, where the user can find information about the product. After signing in, they can also place a bid 
on an item that they want to get and add it to their watchlist, similar to a wishlist that one may have while shopping. Any signed in user can also add items to the auction
, where they can fix their starting bid and add all the details in the description box. If the auction item is owned by the current user, then there's also an option
to close an auction, where the person with the highest bid, wins the item. The item then becomes inactive and can not be found unless it is in someone's watchlist.


#### This Project was written in VSCode using Django framework.
